# Firewall and IDS\IPS Evasion - Hard Lab

Now this lab is hard becasue to evade the IDS/IPS there are allot of flags that need to be used

After the scan if everythig went well we are going to see a service running on port 50000 tcpwrapped

Now we can try connectiong to that port with netcat and obtain the flag

 Attempts to connect to port 50000 on 10.129.2.47.
 Uses port 53 as the outbound port â†’ This can bypass firewalls because DNS traffic (port 53) is often allowed through firewalls.
 Displays detailed connection information.

 # Conclusion
Overall, this lab serves as a critical foundation for anyone pursuing a career in penetration testing. The reconnaissance phase, combined with in-depth Nmap enumeration, forms the backbone of any successful penetration test. By systematically gathering information about the target and identifying potential attack vectors, the tester establishes a solid basis for the subsequent exploitation phase. Mastery of these techniques not only improves efficiency but also increases the likelihood of uncovering vulnerabilities that might otherwise remain hidden.
