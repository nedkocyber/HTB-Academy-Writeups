rpcclient is a command-line utility used to interact with Windows or Samba servers over the RPC (Remote Procedure Call) protocol. Itâ€™s particularly useful during enumeration in penetration testing or system administration.

With rpcclient, you can:

 - Enumerate users on the remote system
 - Identify the domain the server belongs to
 - List available shared folders (shares)
 - Gather information about groups and permissions
