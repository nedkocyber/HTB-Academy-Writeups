# IMAP/POP3

IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol)

Allows direct access to emails on the server without downloading them locally.
Emails remain on the server until explicitly deleted.
Supports folders and hierarchical structure, syncing across multiple devices (mobile, desktop, etc.).
Operates on port 143 (unencrypted) or port 993 (with TLS/SSL encryption).
Without encryption, username and password are transmitted in plain text!
Uses commands like LOGIN, SELECT, FETCH, LOGOUT, etc.

POP3 (Post Office Protocol v3)

Older and simpler protocol â€“ downloads emails locally and removes them from the server.
Does not support folders or synchronization across devices.
Runs on port 110 (unencrypted) or port 995 (with TLS/SSL).
Suitable for single-device use without needing access from multiple clients.

Using openssl s_client -connect 10.129.240.178:pop3s and openssl s_client -connect 10.129.240.178:imaps, we establish secure connections to both the POP3S and IMAPS services respectively.
