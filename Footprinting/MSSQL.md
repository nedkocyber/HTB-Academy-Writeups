MSSQL Overview

MSSQL is a relational database management system (RDBMS) developed by Microsoft.
Unlike MySQL, which is open-source, MSSQL is proprietary.
While primarily designed for Windows, it also has versions for Linux and macOS.
Commonly used in applications developed with the .NET framework.
In penetration testing, tools like mssqlclient.py from the Impacket toolkit are frequently used for interaction and exploitation.

After performing a basic nmap -sCV scan to identify open ports, service versions, and run default scripts, we were able to retrieve valuable information about the target system.
