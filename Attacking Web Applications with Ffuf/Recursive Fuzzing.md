# Recursive Fuzzing

It's important to understand that ffuf is not the only tool capable of recursive directory or file discovery. While ffuf is powerful and widely used, the key takeaway is that tools are situational â€” what truly matters is the methodology behind the testing.

Relying solely on one tool just because you're familiar with it can be limiting. Instead, knowing how and why a technique works allows you to apply the same logic across different tools (e.g., dirb, gobuster, feroxbuster, etc.), adapting to the context and environment.
