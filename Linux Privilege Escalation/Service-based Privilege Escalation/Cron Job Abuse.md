# Cron Job Abuse

We begin with -->  find / -path /proc -prune -o -type f -perm -o+w 2>/dev/null  this command searches the entire filesystem (starting from /) for world-writable files.

During enumeration, we discover the file backup.sh, which is world-writable while being executed with root privileges. This misconfiguration allows any user on the system to modify the scriptâ€™s contents. By injecting malicious commands into backup.sh, we can leverage its execution to escalate privileges and obtain a root shell.

Here we add a reverse shell

The critical aspect of this misconfiguration is that backup.sh runs periodically with root privileges, regardless of whether it is triggered manually or executed automatically by the system (e.g., via a scheduled task such as cron).

To exploit this, we insert a reverse shell payload into backup.sh, start a Netcat listener on our attacking machine, and wait for the script to execute. Once it runs, the payload is executed as root, providing us with a privileged shell.
