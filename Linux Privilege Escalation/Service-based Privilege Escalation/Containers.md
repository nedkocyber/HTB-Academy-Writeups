We import an Alpine Linux image into LXC and assign it the alias ubuntuteam

Upon successful import, LXC confirms with a message and the image fingerprint.

We initialize a privileged Alpine container named privesc from the ubuntuteam image (security.privileged=true) and mount the hostâ€™s root filesystem inside it (/mnt/root). After starting the container and accessing its shell, we immediately have full root privileges on the host (uid=0, gid=0), enabling unrestricted access and modification of the host system.
